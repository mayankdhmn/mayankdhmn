<p align="center"> <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mayankDhiman&show_icons=true&theme=gruvbox_light" alt="mayankDhiman" />

- ⚡️ I am a Software Engineer at Google in Google Docs, and CS Gold Medallist from NIT Hamirpur.

- 🌪 I am looking to regain my Open Source contribution streak, which has been pretty low 😑 due to interview preparation. So, I am looking to contribute in any Project I find interesting (HMU 😏). I also like to refine my Coffee Brewing Skills ☕️ (see: Moka Pots, see: James Hoffman), and I am learning to be one sexy ass digital artist 👨‍🎨. And, I love reading books. Art of War, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Brief History of Time are some of the sexiest books I read this year. Big Fan. 

- 📬 Talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mayank1dhiman), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-dhiman/), or on [E-Mail](mailto:mdhiman536@gmail.com). Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Huh.
