- Hi, I‚Äôm @mayankdhmn (aka @mayankDhiman).
- @mayankDhiman is inaccessible due to 2 Factor Authentication Problem.

- I currently work at @salesforce, and will be joining @google this Feb.
- I am a CS Gold Medallist from NIT Hamirpur. I have worked at @paypal, and was a Google Summer of Code participant with @aerospaceresearch.

- I am looking to regain my Open Source Contribution Streak, which had been on a low note due to extensive interview preparation.
- So, I am looking to contribute in any Project I find interesting (HMU). 

- I also like to refine my Coffee Brewing Skills ‚òïÔ∏è (see: Moka Pots, see: James Hoffman), and I am learning to be one sexy ass digital artist üë®‚Äçüé®.
- And, I love reading books. Art of War, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Brief History of Time are some of the sexiest books I read this year. Big Fan. 

- Talk with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mayank1dhiman), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayank-dhiman/), or on [E-Mail](mailto:mdhiman536@gmail.com). 
- Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Huh.
